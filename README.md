Password Generator Program developed during my internship at CODSOFT. This Python-based CLI application generates secure passwords based on user preferences, offering both simplicity and complexity options. The program prompts users to specify the desired password length and complexity level, providing a convenient and efficient solution for generating strong and unique passwords. Created as part of my internship project at CODSOFT, this tool demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming and commitment to enhancing cybersecurity practices.
